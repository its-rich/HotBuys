# What is this?
This website will search for the cheapest price listed online for a product at selected stores. It uses individual Google Cloud Functions to scrape information about the product at each store. The stores are found by interacting with a HTTP API Lambda Function to access the latest JSON in the Amazon S3 bucket, ultimately dictating what web scrapers are available.
